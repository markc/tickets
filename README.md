## Email-to-Ticket Features

### How It Works

3. **System processes** email and creates ticket/reply
4. **Notifications sent** with Reply-To headers for threading
5. **Customers reply** to continue conversation

### Email Address Patterns
- **New tickets**: `support@yourdomain.com`
- **Replies**: `support+{ticket-uuid}@yourdomain.com`
- **Automatic routing** based on UUID in email address
